Im don't put just anything on my face because I know how I want my face to look and what I want from a face product. My skin care routine consists of: cleansing, serum, eye cream, moisturizer. I always felt like my face is dry with texture even though is oily and I use gentle products. I started using a glycolic acid serum which has helped with my texture. But this gel cream, along with the hydra booster mixed, and aplied before my moisturizer is exactly what I needed. Always felt my face tight even after using any rich moisturizer but what I needed is the water or wetness(hydration that this provides) I love it. I personally bought it because it was blue.",
